# Mid-Air Volumetric Hologram Display Concept

Open-source conceptual idea (no prototype, no code yet)

CC0 1.0 Universal (Public Domain) — use freely, no restrictions.

## 1. Project Overview
High-level plan for a floor-based interactive mid-air volumetric display (~1 m³ volume) with:
- Screenless 3D holograms viewable from multiple angles
- Mid-air gesture/touch input (sparse LiDAR)
- Optional ultrasound mid-air haptics (feel virtual objects)

Goal: Affordable, open design with potential medical & education use cases.

**Status**: Pure concept — shared for discussion and improvement.

## 2. Core Architecture

### Base
- 1 m × 1 m floor panel

### Projection
- Target: laser-induced plasma, optical trapping, or light-field
- Aim: ~1 mm³ voxels in 1 m³ volume

### Input
- 4 ToF LiDAR sensors (one per corner)
- Triangulate hand/finger position
- Detect taps, swipes, pinches

### Haptics (optional)
- 40 kHz ultrasound phased array
- Focused pressure points on skin

## 3. Target Specs (aspirational)
- Volume: 1 m³
- Refresh: 60–120 Hz
- Power: <150 W
- Cost goal: <$2000 prototype

## 4. Applications (focus)
- Surgical planning & rehearsal
- Medical education (virtual anatomy)
- Telemedicine with haptic feedback
- Rehab exercises

## 5. Known Challenges
- Scale of true mid-air projection
- Haptic range (~0.5 m³ realistic today)
- Laser safety
- Occlusion & latency

## 6. Next Steps / Invitation
Feel free to fork, comment, improve, build small tests.

Discussion welcome in issues.
